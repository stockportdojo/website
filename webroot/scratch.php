                <h3>Why Scratch?</h3>
                <p>Scratch is a program designed to teach people how code used in computer
                    programming is structured.</p> <p> It is a flexible platform, often used as a learning
                    aid because it lays out the code and the game side by side which helps the user
                    think about the code logically as it is run.</p><p> We use scratch for the less
                    experienced ninjas although it can be used to create more complicated games
                    with a more detailed knowledge of how the code is applied.</p>
