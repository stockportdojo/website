                <h3>Hack Manchester Junior 2016</h3>
                <p>Hack Manchester Junior is a two day coding competition for those 18 and under. Teams of up to four turn up with an idea and have two days to present a working product!</p>
                <p>Four of our young ninjas, Peter, William, Sam and Danny, tackled the Clockwork challenge which was 'Use SMS to combat evil'. They created an app, using Android Studio, called 'Bully Button'. This sends an emergency text to a parent's phone with a single tap of a big red button.</p>
                <p>The judges said they were impressed with the way they approached the problem and the teamwork they displayed. After the two days they had a working app with refined design. They came first in the Clockwork challenge; the prize was four ThiEye Mini Action Cameras i30 and four different superhero costumes.
